# Automated Redteaming

This project contains descriptions of how GenAI tools could be used to help augment automated red teaming. This includes example prompts and chat histories.
Please note that this project has been explicitly designed not to cause issues with spreading harmful prompts to bad actors.
Thus we guide the process to avoid harmful prompts (in this public repo)

## Features

- LangChain-based red teaming scenarios
- OpenAI API integration
- Automated rewording of known prompt attacks to LLM vulnerabilities

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your API keys in `api_key.env`
3. Read through the Chat Log text file.
4. Run the scripts to generate and analyze red teaming scenarios
